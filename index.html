        <p>I am a computer science and mathematics student at the University of Virginia. In my current position as a computational mathematics reasearcher, I write tests in C++ and Python in order to analyze data structure and algorithm performance. Previously, I worked for the Frank Batten School of Public Policy and Leadership as an IT assistant, where I worked hardware installation and troubleshooting as well as website development. Through a combination of classes and work experience, I have some practical knowledge with other programming languages and technologies such as JavaScript, C, SQL, HTML, CSS, etc. In my <a href="https://github.com/brianaguirre">GitHub</a> page you'll find some of my recent projects, as well as previous work. </p>

        <p>I'm currently looking for a software developement intership - if you're interested in my work and think I'd be a good fit for your company, please <a href="mailto:brian.n.aguirre@gmail.com">contact me</a>.</p>

<p><em>Frnnfluence</em> (pronounced as if 'friend' and 'influence' were mashed together) is an app that I am currently working on with @helenvholmes. A simple SMS app, <em>Frnnfluence</em> allows you to announce when and where you're working out so that friends can RSVP. Unlike announcing it on twitter or facebook, our app was meant to be small, light-weight (since it's an SMS app, a larger audience can use it) and meant only to text close friends that you actually want to know when and where you're working out.</p>

<p>While the app is by no means finished, because what <em>was</em> built was done over the course of a day at a hackathon it was an opportunity to try out some new, cool technologies that I haven't had the opportunity to use in school. </p>
