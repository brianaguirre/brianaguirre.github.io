        <h3><a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

        <p> Hi, my name is Brian Aguirre. I recently graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in <b>Computer Science</b> and <b>Mathematics</b> from the <em>University of Virginia</em>. On top of engineering and software development education, I also worked as a Computational Mathematics and CS research assistant for the Engineering School and College of A&S. As a research assistant, I develop algorithms in order to analyze data structure performance. A lot of my work revolved around optimizationa and testing and refactoring code using <b>Java</b>, <b>Python</b>, and <b>C++</b>. Previously, I worked for the Frank Batten School of Public Policy and Leadership as an IT assistant, where I handled many software and hardware issues on PC and Mac computers. On top of that, I also did front end development to create a new login site for current staff and students. </p>

        <p>In addition to my school work and work experience, I also really enjoy spending time on side projects. More recently, I worked with the <a href="https://cos.io/">Center for Open Science</a> in order to create an application that curates research based on tag and browsing history. For this site, I mainly used <b>JS</b>, <b>SQL</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and the <b>CoS API</b>. You're welcome to take a look at some of my work recent projects as well as previous work on my <a href="https://github.com/brianaguirre">GitHub</a> page.</p>

        <p>I'm currently looking for full time software development positions, and am willing to relocate - if you're interested in my work and think I'd be a good fit for your company, please <a href="mailto:brian.n.aguirre@gmail.com">contact me</a>.</p>

<p><em>Frnnfluence</em> (pronounced as if 'friend' and 'influence' were mashed together) is an app that I am currently working on with @helenvholmes. A simple SMS app, <em>Frnnfluence</em> allows you to announce when and where you're working out so that friends can RSVP. Unlike announcing it on twitter or facebook, our app was meant to be small, light-weight (since it's an SMS app, a larger audience can use it) and meant only to text close friends that you actually want to know when and where you're working out.</p>

<p>While the app is by no means finished, because what <em>was</em> built was done over the course of a day at a hackathon it was an opportunity to try out some new, cool technologies that I haven't had the opportunity to use in school. </p>
